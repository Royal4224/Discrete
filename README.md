# Discrete


1. Using the premises
i. 𝑝 ∨ 𝑞 → ¬𝑟
ii. (𝑝 ∨ 𝑟) ∧ 𝑞
Provide a formal deductive argument with the conclusion “p”. Justify each step.

Because (ii) is true, q must be true. Then, (p v q) is true. Since (p v q) -> ¬𝑟, r must be false. Then, since (p v r) ∧ q is true, (p v r) must be true. Since r is false, p must be true.
