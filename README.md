1. Using the premises
i. 𝑝 ∨ 𝑞 → ¬𝑟
ii. (𝑝 ∨ 𝑟) ∧ 𝑞
Provide a formal deductive argument with the conclusion “p”. Justify each step.

Because (ii) is true, q must be true. Then, (p v q) is true. Since (p v q) -> ¬𝑟, r must be false. Then, since (p v r) ∧ q is true, (p v r) must be true. Since r is false, p must be true. 


1. q by (ii)
2. p v q by 1
3. ¬𝑟 by 2 and (i)
4. (p v r) by (ii)
5. p by 3 and 4

2. Provide a deductive proof to show that from the premises
(𝑝 ∧ 𝑞) → 𝑟
¬𝑟 → (𝑝 ∧ 𝑞)
𝑝 ∨ 𝑞
𝑟 → ¬𝑞
Provide a formal deductive argument with the conclusion “p”. Justify each step.

3. Prove that (¬𝑝 → ((𝑞 ∨ 𝑟) ∧ (¬𝑞 ∧ ¬𝑟)) → 𝑝 is a tautology using the rules of logic.
